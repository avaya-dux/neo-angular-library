# neo-angular-library
A Angular implementation of the Avaya Neo Design system.

## TODOs

- Create an angular library.
- Provide a way to view components of that library. Such as an example app, a storybook site (which [is what neo-react does](https://neo-react-library-storybook.netlify.app)), or another solution that makes the most sense.
- Setup a publish process for this library (Joe to do).
- Contact legal about any getting a license for this project (both neo-react and neo-css are open sourced and MIT licenses).
- Ensure strong best practices are followed (unit tests, CICD process, strong documentation, ect.).
